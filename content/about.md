Hello. My name is Antonis Pavlakis (pronounced Adoni), and I'm a software developer. I can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pavlakis) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pavlakis) under the handle `@pavlakis`.


## Community

I've been involved with PHP User Groups since 2010. I was an organiser for [PHP East Midlands](https://phpem.uk) for 5 years, and in 2015 I co-founded [PHPMinds](https://phpminds.org) and I am still one of the organisers.
